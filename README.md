# SixFourThree.BoxPacker
Port of the dvdoug's BoxPacker library (originally written in PHP) to C#.

Min, Mid, and Max C# Heap implementations originally from: https://github.com/matejzavrsnik/blitva
BoxPacker library (originally in PHP) from: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dvdoug/BoxPacker

This library is NOT stable yet. It will build, however, any of the Pack* functions need to be adjusted and tested to ensure that 
the items are being divided properly amongst the boxes.
